    "reasoning": "This warning is required to mitigate 'Failure to Warn' liability. Providing specific 'stop-use' and 'seek-care' triggers shifts the burden of action to the patient, protecting the clinic in the event of rapid clinical deterioration.",
    "category": "Safety",

    "headline": "Antibiotic Compliance Requirement",
    "content": "You must complete the entire 7-day course of antibiotics even if the skin looks normal after a few days. Do not stop early.",
    "reasoning": "Failure to disclose the risks of non-compliance (antibiotic resistance and secondary infection) constitutes a breach of the 'Duty of Care.' Documentation of this instruction prevents negligence claims if the infection returns due to patient error.",

    "content": "Take the Ibuprofen only with food. If you experience sharp stomach pain or notice black, tarry stools, stop the medication immediately and contact us.",
    "reasoning": "Under the 'Informed Consent Doctrine,' clinicians must disclose 'material risks.' Gastric bleeding is a known risk of NSAIDs; failing to provide this warning leaves the clinic vulnerable to a malpractice suit if a GI bleed occurs.",

    "urgency": "Normal",
    "context_reference": "Nurse suggested taking Advil (Ibuprofen) for the pain."

    "headline": "Diagnostic Limitations Disclosure",
    "content": "This is a preliminary assessment based on your current symptoms. A physical examination is required if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours.",
    "reasoning": "This is a legal safeguard for remote or preliminary consultations. It establishes that the assessment has limitations and clearly defines the timeframe for follow-up, protecting the doctor against 'Failure to Diagnose' claims.",

    "content": "It is normal for the area to remain slightly tender and warm for the next 24 hours as the medication begins to work. This is an expected part of the healing process.",
    "reasoning": "Strategic 'Reassurance' prevents 'Anxiety-based Litigation.' By defining what is 'normal,' the clinic prevents the patient from claiming they were 'misled' or 'frightened' by standard recovery symptoms.",

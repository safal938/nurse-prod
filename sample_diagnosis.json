    ],
    "reasoning": "The patient presents with overt jaundice, pruritus, and significantly elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, Alk Phos, Bilirubin), consistent with acute liver injury. The timing of the elevated LFTs and jaundice, occurring shortly after a course of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate and with frequent acetaminophen intake, strongly suggests a drug-induced liver injury. The itching is a common symptom associated with cholestasis. Chronic overuse of acetaminophen is also noted as a potential contributing factor.",

    "reasoning": "The presence of jaundice, significant itching, and elevated alkaline phosphatase, along with elevated transaminases, indicates a cholestatic pattern of liver injury. This suggests impaired bile flow, which is often a component of drug-induced liver injury. While DILI is a strong possibility, other causes of cholestasis, such as biliary obstruction, should be considered.",
